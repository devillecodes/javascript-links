# JavaScript Links

These are links that I've found useful and want to keep track of for future reference. This is by no means meant to be an exhaustive list
of every JavaScript link available, but rather a place to collect links that I've come accross and found useful.

## Libraries

* [VerbalExpressions](https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/JSVerbalExpressions) - Regular expressions made easy
* [Voca](https://github.com/panzerdp/voca) - Extensive string manipulation library

## CI / CD
